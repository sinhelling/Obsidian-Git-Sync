##### The Third age (The Age of Regression)
This age began with the creation of Emmanuel who was created by [[Isaiah - the god of destruction]] to balance the The lesser gods. This is when the Dark Races emerged and the Eternal war began.
At the end of this age the people had lost so much and blamed the gods for the war.
The people wanted independence from the gods and so ended up challenging them.
