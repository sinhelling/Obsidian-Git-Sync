### Background:
Jasper Conroy grew up in a world torn by political strife and social inequality. As a talented flute player, he found solace in music, but his observations of the world around him filled him with a desire for change. Believing that the current state of affairs is unsustainable, he seeks to bring about a radical transformation, one that would reshape the world into a unified whole.

His vision is to create a world where everyone is equal, regardless of status or wealth. He believes that achieving this goal requires drastic measures, even if it means risking everything.
### Role:
Despite his musical talents, Jasper's true role lies in his political influence. He has managed to establish himself in positions of power, using his charisma and cunning to sway others to his cause. While he may not hold a formal title, his behind-the-scenes maneuvering allows him to shape events to his liking.
### Beliefs:
Jasper firmly believes that a unified ideology is the key to a better world. He is willing to do whatever it takes to achieve this, even if it means resorting to questionable means. To him, the end justifies the means, and he is prepared to make sacrifices along the way.

In his quest to reset the world, Jasper seeks out the legendary 7 Artifacts of Sin. These powerful magic items are based on the seven deadly sins, each possessing unique abilities tied to its respective sin. Jasper believes that by collecting and harnessing the power of these artifacts, he can unlock the key to resetting the world. However, what he may not realize is that these artifacts also serve as the keys to unleashing Gormagalion, an ancient black dragon once bound by Emmanuel, a pre-established god from a bygone age. Gormagalion release could bring about catastrophic consequences, but Jasper's single-minded determination blinds him to the potential dangers.
### Relationship with Gormagalion:
Jasper sees Gormagalion not as a threat, but as a means to an end. He views the ancient dragon as a powerful force that can be harnessed to bring about the change he desires.
