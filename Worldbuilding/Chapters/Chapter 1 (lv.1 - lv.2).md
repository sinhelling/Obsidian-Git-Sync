### The Small Village and the Emergence of Magic (lv.1 - lv.2)
- The campaign begins in the small village of Silverscar where the characters live ordinary lives, unaware of the magcal potential lying dormant within them.
- Through various circumstances (encounters wiith ancient relics, strange occurrences, etc.), the characters awaken their latent magical abilities.
- Their emergence as magic users attracts the attention of the main villain, who sees them as threats to their plans for dominance.
- The villain dispatches agents or minions to the village to capture or eliminate the characters, inadvertently putting the entire village in danger.
- The characters defend their home against the initial attack, but the encounter leaves them with no choice but to flee, realizing that their actions have endangered their loved ones and neighbors.
- ##### Recognition by Local Authorities
	- As the characters begin to demonstrate their magical abilities and embark on their journey, local authorities in their villages may take notice. This could lead to a range of reactions, from suspicion and fear to admiration and support.
	- The village leaders could seek to leverage the characters' newfound powers for the benefit of the community, perhaps appointing them as unofficial protectors or advisors.
