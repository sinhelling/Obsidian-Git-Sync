## General Planing
### System 
* We will play D&D 5E
### Schedule
* Every other week.
* After each session the DM will create a poll for which day fits best for the next play week. (Can also plan two weeks in advance if that is easier.)
### Continuity
- Are the sessions episodic? Large arcs? Combination? Are the sessions episodic? Large arcs? Combination? 
### Rating
- R
### Style
*  Is the game focused on exploration?  Social (investigation, political, etc), action? Heavy or light combat? 
### Tone
* The general tone is light with room for humor at the table but space for more dramatic scenes and even some darker moments sprinkled in.
### Campaign Scope
* The  Campaign will go from level 1 to level 12. (So plan Accordingly)
* Approximately 50 Sessions 
### digital tools
* DndBeyond
* Foundry VTT
* Discord

## Characters

### Starting level
* Lvl 1
### Background
* Alle er Human
* Dere er alle fra et lite tettsted som Heter Silverscar som ligger i utkanten av en skog.
* Dette stedet driver mye med skog eller landbruk.
* De fleste husene ligger ganske spredt. noen lengre inn i skogen andre lengre ut på landet.
* Men dere har et lite tettsted hvor det er et lite marked og et tavern der flere liker å dra inn til for å sosialisere

**Downtime -** How will downtime and associated events (magic item creation, etc.) be handled?  Before or after a regular session? Between games via email / Forums / Discord? Etc? 

## Rules

**Rule Zero** - Is it in play or not?  

**Rules Variance -** If using any custom rules changes (ignore encumbrance being the most popular) or additional subsystems are allowed. You don't need to put more than "Extensive House Rules"  

**Outside Sources -** This is not only where you list any non-core books that are in play but is also where you would make note of it if you are willing to review prospective new sources submitted by your players. 
**Firearms** - Do they exist in your game? If so, to what extent? In games like Pathfinder 1e, I will generally denote the level of firearms here, ranging from emerging to commonplace   
**Psionics** - Some love ‘em, some hate ‘em. Either way, it's always good to know upfront if they're part of the program.
