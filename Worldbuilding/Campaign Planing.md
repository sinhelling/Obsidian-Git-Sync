## Characters

### Starting level
* Lvl 1
### Background
* Alle er Human
* Dere er alle fra et lite tettsted som Heter Silverscar som ligger i utkanten av en skog.
* Dette stedet driver mye med skog eller landbruk.
* De fleste husene ligger ganske spredt. noen lengre inn i skogen andre lengre ut på landet.
* Men dere har et lite tettsted hvor det er et lite marked og et tavern der flere liker å dra inn til for å sosialisere

**Downtime -** How will downtime and associated events (magic item creation, etc.) be handled?  Before or after a regular session? Between games via email / Forums / Discord? Etc? 

## Rules

##### Rule Zero
##### Flanking blir Advantage inntil videre

**Outside Sources -** This is not only where you list any non-core books that are in play but is also where you would make note of it if you are willing to review prospective new sources submitted by your players. 
**Firearms** - Do they exist in your game? If so, to what extent? In games like Pathfinder 1e, I will generally denote the level of firearms here, ranging from emerging to commonplace   
**Psionics** - Some love ‘em, some hate ‘em. Either way, it's always good to know upfront if they're part of the program.
## Safety Tools
### Hard Line
* Rape
* Sexual violence 
### Soft line
* Infidelity (utroskap)
* Sexuell ladet flørting er en soft linje.
